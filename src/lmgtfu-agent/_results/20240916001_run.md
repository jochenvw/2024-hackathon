# Prompt
You are an expert in Azure services and their integrations with Azure Backup. Please check whether each of the following Azure services can be backed up using Azure Backup. 
Return the results in a markdown table with the following columns:

- **Service Name**: The name of the Azure service.
- **Can Be Backed Up with Azure Backup**: Yes or No.
- **Backup Method**: If Yes, explain the backup method. If No, explain why it can't be backed up using Azure Backup.
- **URL**: URL that provides explanation for the claim.

Here is the list of Azure services to check:

- Azure Blob Storage
- Azure SQL Database
- Azure App Service
- Azure Virtual Machines
- Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)
- Azure Cosmos DB

Return the results in a properly formatted markdown table.

# Observation
Mistakes in Cosmos and App Service I believe. Maybe need to specify "Azure Backup Service" specifically?
